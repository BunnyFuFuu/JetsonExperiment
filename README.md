# JetsonExperiment

This repository is actually a very stripped down version of the full repo. This makes use of the Jetson-Inference repository over at https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference. I made use of the detectnet code here, so that's what I'm putting here. For my project, rather than change what already worked, I wanted to do an actual application to real world, where I experimented with the results of pretrained nets (SSD-Mobilenet) on a pedestrian dataset I found online, or the FudanPennPed dataset. I wanted to see how it would do with inference on something based on what I was already doing in class and research, so autonomous vehicles to see how it could be done on a Jetson. The next step to take with this project is to train and design better pedestrian detection algorithms rather than using a pre built one.
